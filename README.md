Solar Web Site

This is my attempt to pull in several resources regarding Solar power in homes, tiny homes, RVs, campers, etc.  It will include resources such as calculators, product links, reviews, a forum for help, and a blog (mostly detailing my current testing of a small solar setup).

Instructions:
Clone this repository.
Change directory into the new folder.
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py shell -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
Copy/paste the output of this command into a .env file.
(i.e. SECRET_KEY=kdkfjknvkldsjf234jkl)
